# My-CCNA_prep
I'm currently preparing for my CCNA 200-301 Exam. During this preparation, I build some labs on various topics of Networking with the help of Cisco Packet Tracer


LAB 1 : In this lab ,I assigned appropiate IP address to the router interfaces and saved the running config to startup config. PC-1, PC-2 & PC-3 can communicate with each other now.
