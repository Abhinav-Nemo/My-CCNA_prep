I'm currently preparing for my CCNA 200-301 Exam. During this preparation, I build some labs on various topics of Networking with the help of Cisco Packet Tracer


LAB 1 : In this lab ,I assigned appropiate IP address to the router interfaces and saved the running config to startup config. PC-1, PC-2 & PC-3 can communicate with each other now.

FTP&TFTP lab : In this lab, file transfer protocols such as FTP & TFTP are used to transfer files from server to the router.

DHCP lab : In this lab, R1 is the DHCP server. DHCP pools are created for 3 different networks. R2 is assigned as a DHCP relay agent for the HR network.   


3 TIER ARCH : A model of an enterprize network with a access layer, distribution layer and a core layer. Layer 2 trunking is used to seperate vlans. OSPF is used in to configure routes in the network. Layer 3 of the network(CORE layer) is in a different vlan seperated from the other layers. A server provides the IP address to the network via DHCP. A default route to internet with NAT is used to translate IP address going out. HSRP is used to provide redundancy to the network.


OSPF lab : In this lab, PC in local network send traffic to ISP router. To simulate real world, there are 4 routers which are part of the company's internal network. OSPF is used as the routing protocol. OSPF is enabled on each interface of the router. 


WLC Lab : A network consisting of lightweight wireless accesspoint, Wireless Lan controler, DHCP server, a layer 3 switch and clients. DHCP server is used to give IP address to access points. Configured WLC with two WLAN. A guest network with no security functions and a staff network with WPA-WPA2 with AES encryption.
