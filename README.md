I'm currently preparing for my CCNA 200-301 Exam. During this preparation, I build some labs on various topics of Networking with the help of Cisco Packet Tracer


LAB 1 : In this lab ,I assigned appropiate IP address to the router interfaces and saved the running config to startup config. PC-1, PC-2 & PC-3 can communicate with each other now.

LAb 2 : In this lab, file transfer protocols such as FTP & TFTP are used to transfer files from server to the router.

LAB 3 : In this lab, R1 is the DHCP server. DHCP pools are created for 3 different networks. R2 is assigned as a DHCP relay agent for the HR network.
